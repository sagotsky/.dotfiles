## dk

A list based tiling window manager in the vein of dwm, bspwm, and xmonad.

Some basics:

- Fully scriptable.
- Dynamic workspaces.
- More dynamic tile layout.
- Gaps, fancy borders, extra layouts and more.
- Better support for mouse and floating windows.
- Startup script for configuration and running programs.
- Status info is output to a file for use in bars or scripts.
- No built-in extras *(bar, font drawing, or key bindings)*.
- Sane support for
[icccm](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xorg-docs/specs/ICCCM/icccm.html#client_to_window_manager_communication),
[ewmh](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html), and
[motif](http://www.ist.co.uk/motif/books/vol6A/ch-20.fm.html#963509).


### Installation

You need the xcb headers

Arch
```
xcb-proto xcb-util xcb-util-wm xcb-util-cursor xcb-util-keysyms
```

Debian/Ubuntu
```
build-essential libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev
```

Other systems should have packages with similar names.

As mentioned above dk has no keybind support so you'll need a separate  
program like `sxhkd` to launch programs and control the window manager.


To compile run
```
make
```

Edit `config.h` if needed, then run *(as root if needed)*
```
make install
```

If at any time you want to uninstall, run
```
make uninstall
```


### Usage

To start dk you can add the following to your `~/.xinitrc`
```
exec dk
```

Optionally copy the example dkrc and/or sxhkdrc to their respective locations
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/sxhkd ~/.config/dk
cp /usr/local/share/doc/dk/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd/
cp /usr/local/share/doc/dk/dkrc ~/.config/dk/
chmod +x ~/.config/dk/dkrc
```

### Configuration

There are example `dkrc` and `sxhkdrc` files in `doc/` or  
`/usr/local/share/doc/dk` after installation.

dk looks for a file in the following order
```
$DKRC                     # user specified location
$HOME/.config/dk/dkrc     # default location
```
and to runs it, **it must be executable in order for this to happen**.

Advanced changes and configuration like new layouts, callbacks, or commands  
can be done by copying the default config header `config.def.h` to `config.h`,  
editing it and recompiling. This file isn't tracked by git so you can keep your  
configuration and avoid conflicts when pulling new updates.

### dkcmd
Most of your interaction with the window manager will be using `dkcmd`  
which writes one or more commands into the socket where it is then read  
and parsed by the window manager *(see Commands section below)*.


### Syntax Outline
The commands have a very basic syntax and parsing, the input is broken  
down into smaller pieces *(tokens)* which are then passed to the matching  
keyword function, otherwise an error is returned.

Tokens are delimited by one or more:

- whitespace *(space or tab)*

- quotation mark *(`'` or `"`)*

- equal sign *(`=`)*

This means the following inputs are all equivalent.
```
setting=value
setting value
setting="value"
setting = 'value'
setting "value"
setting		"value"
```
and result in two tokens: `setting` and `value`

---

Quotation exists as a way to preserve whitespace and avoid interpretation by the shell,  
otherwise we have no way of determining whether an argument is a continuation of the  
previous or the beginning of the next. Consider the following
```
title="^open files$"
```

If the value being matched has quotes in it, they can be escaped or strong quoted
```
title="^\"preserved quotes\"$"
title='^"preserved quotes"$'
```

---

For various commands dk will expect a certain data type or format to be given.

- string: normal plain text, must be less than 256 characters.

- boolean: `true`, `false`, `1`, or `0`.

- hex: `(0x/#)XXXXXXXX`, used for window ids

- integer: `(+/-)1`, if it is preceded by a sign it is considered relative.

- float: `(+/-)0.1`, same as integer but must contain a decimal value.

- colour: `(0x/#)[AA]RRGGBB`, hex value, if no alpha channel is given the colour is opaque.

---

### Commands
```
dkcmd COMMAND
