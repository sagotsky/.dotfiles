including |tags|.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*unite-tag-usage*

To select tags, execute |:Unite| with argument of tag
>
	:Unite tag
<
To select files including tags, execute |:Unite| with argument of tag/file
>
	:Unite tag/file
<
To select include tags generated like |tagbar| or |ctrlp|, execute
|:Unite| with argument of tag/include.
Note: |neocomplcache| or |neocomplete| is needed.
>
	:Unite tag/include
<
This plugin does not block vim because tags' information are aggregated
asynchronously.


==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZE						*unite-tag-customize*

If you want to unite-tag instead of |<C-]>|, try to write below in your vimrc.
This allows you to use unite-tag only in normal buffers.
>
    autocmd BufEnter *
    \   if empty(&buftype)
    \|      nnoremap <buffer> <C-]> :<C-u>UniteWithCursorWord -immediately tag<CR>
    \|  endif
<

==============================================================================
FAQ							*unite-tag-faq*

Q: I want to open files without generating tags files like ctrlp.vim or
tagbar plugin.

A: You can use "tag/include" source. But it needs |neocomplcache| or
|neocomplete| plugin. It uses automatically generated tag files.
